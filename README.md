# Snake Game - Python (Pygame)

Welcome to the **Snake Game** repository! This is a classic snake game developed in Python using the `pygame` library. The game features a quirky snake that reacts to user input with smooth controls and vibrant visuals. The objective is simple: guide the snake to eat food, grow longer, and avoid crashing into walls or itself.

## Demo

To try out the game, clone this repository and run the game locally, or watch the demo video [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=example_link).

## Prerequisites

Before you can run the game, you need to have Python installed along with the `pygame` library.

1. **Install Python**: Make sure Python is installed on your machine. You can download it from [here](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

2. **Install Pygame**: The game requires the `pygame` library, which can be installed via pip. You can do this by running the following command in your terminal or command prompt:

   ```bash
   pip install pygame
   ```

## Installation

Follow the steps below to get the game up and running on your local machine:

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Naga-2426/snake-game.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project folder:

   ```bash
   cd snake-game
   ```

3. Install dependencies:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

   *(If you don't have a `requirements.txt`, simply ensure that `pygame` is installed as shown above.)*

4. Run the game:

   ```bash
   python snake_game.py
   ```

   *(Make sure to replace `snake_game.py` with the actual Python file if it’s named differently.)*

## How to Play

1. Use the **arrow keys** (Up, Down, Left, Right) to navigate the snake.
2. The snake will grow longer as it eats the **red food**.
3. Avoid **hitting the walls** or the **snake's own body**.
4. The game ends when the snake collides with itself or a wall.
5. Once you lose, press **C** to restart or **Q** to quit the game.
